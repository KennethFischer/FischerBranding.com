							<div class="section_title"><strong> The Challenge </strong></div>
							<br>
							<div class="p4"><strong>Was to create a cloud storage &amp; organization app like Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, etc. </strong
							<br>
							<br>
							• The client requested me to created the name &amp; the branding.
							<br>
							• The client was not sure if this should just be a desktop or mobile app.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong> Features Needed:</strong>
							<br>
							1. Saving Content (links, images, videos, etc.)
							<br>
							2. Organizing Content categories, tags, groups, and/or folders
							<br>
							3. Creating Content (notes, documents and spreadsheets)
							<br>
							4. Uploading Files (videos, images, PDFs, etc.) from computer or mobile device
							<br>
							5. Sharing items, folders with others (&amp; vice-versa)
							<br>
							6. Collaboration with other users real-time in notes or documents.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Key points of differentiation with this app is collaboration. By leveraging the “network effect”, it should generate growth.</strong>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<div class="section_title_3"><strong>The Solution </strong></div>
							<br>
							<strong>Was the creation of the Boomerang Cloud Storage App! Have all the functionality that was requested plus more!</strong>
							<br>
							<br>	
							<strong> Problems this product solves for its users: </strong>
							<br>
							1. The 6 points just mentioned.
							<br>
							2. Highly Customization: The ability to store or share folders with whom ever you want. Examples: jobs, projects, music, pictures, albums, videos etc. If it can be saved on a computer you can save it on the cloud.
							<br>
							3. Real-Time Collaboration &amp; Sharing: A place to share and collaborate over projects almost immediately stored on the cloud with friends, coworkers even clients. This can help with your workflow or just networking with friends.
							<br>
							4. Accessibility: Be able to save or download files from desktop &amp; mobile devices anywhere. 
							<br>
							5. Scalability with price plans to fit anyone’s needs: That can be changed with a touch of your finger.
							<br>
							6. Disaster Recovery &amp; Storage Immortality / back up drives.

						<br>
						<br>
						<div class="p1"> To better understand the cloud storage app market I began researching the competitors. After identifying the features, prices and target audience I performed a SWOT Analysis and created User Flows on the competitor’s desktop apps. This information allowed me to see potential gaps in current services and untapped opportunities for a new product. I then performed a Survey with respondents that had experience using cloud storage apps. This helped not only to create an app that I thought the market could use but also helped me understand what type of cloud storage app many users felt would be useful to the market. This is where the opportunity was given to be able to see if my initial assumptions were right or wrong. Finally I created User Personas of two very different individuals to put a face and personality to the target consumer.</div>

By referencing User Flows created from the Competitive Analysis I was able to see how competitors mapped out tasks similar to those I wanted in this app. Time was then spent on designing Wireframes with pen and paper to create quick options for the sights logic, visual consistency and navigation. This helped to ensure the site stayed simple and clean for the end user and I was then able to create the first clickable prototype for my Usability Tests. Three different users were tested where they were given three to four tasks in which they provided invaluable feedback for how the product could be optimized even more user friendly. </div>

This time I focused on the competitors in the cloud storage market and other applications making an impact in the market. After creating several potentially viable names, I chose Boomerang because I felt it resonated the best with our target audience. The boomerang is known for being thrown and returning back to the user, the cloud storage app does a similar function and this is why the name Boomerang was chosen; along with being a lighthearted and memorable name as well. I then created sketches of logo concepts attempting to capture a high quality looking logo that evoked a confidant, youthful and a lighthearted feeling. This was all done while not losing focus on the social collaboration aspect of the app and the specified target consumer “Millennials”. It was now time to create the style guide and mood board to help set the tone and style of the end product.

						<div class="p1"> I was now finally able to see how all the pieces were going to come together by starting to create the high fidelity mockups for both the desktop and mobile versions. I started by applying style guide requirements and looking at each page as a whole; as well as source high quality images and other resources the style guide did not provide to help create the best user interface and experience possible. There were still decisions to make on the overall user interface that would need to be brought to the preference testing to help get clarity. I conducted three separate preference tests to get user feedback on different design elements. The tested design elements were then edited on the mockup to reflect the users’ most popular choices. Then another user test was performed on both platforms with the same previous users. Feedback was positive; all users felt like it was a much better experience. </div>

		<article class="text_2">The User Surveys proved to be extremely beneficial for the development of 		this app. Researching the User Flows of competitors was extremely helpful in guiding the app on 		what screens and modal windows to create. Perhaps the greatest learning curve for me was watching a 	user struggle with a requested task during the usability test that I thought was simple. I empathized     with the user and wanted to solve the problem for them. After some research I made a major change to 		the apps navigation in which to my surprise all the users who tested the updated app preferred it to 	 the original. I know a more in-depth study of how competitors conduct similar processes can be done, 	  however I feel that the Usability Testing was a great way to determine what did and did not work for 	 the Boomerang Cloud Storage App.
